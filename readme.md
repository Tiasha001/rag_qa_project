origin of the Kalapani dispute
AI: The origin of the Kalapani dispute lies in the differing views between Nepal and India regarding the origin of River Kali, which was demarcated as a boundary in the Treaty of Sagauli (1816). Nepal believes the river to the west of Kalapani is the main River Kali, while India argues that it originates from a smaller rivulet named Pankhagad. Thank you.
